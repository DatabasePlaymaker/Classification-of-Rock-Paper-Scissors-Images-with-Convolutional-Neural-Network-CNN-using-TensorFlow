# Classification-of-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Images-with-Convolutional-Neural-Network-CNN-using-TensorFlow
Final Project to fulfill the Machine Learning for Beginners competency certification
- The dataset used must be the following dataset: rockpaperscissors, or use this link in the wget command: https://github.com/dicodingacademy/assets/releases/download/release/rockpaperscissors.zip.
- The dataset must be divided into train set and validation set.
- The size of the validation set must be 40% of the total dataset (training data has 1314 samples, and validation data has 874 samples).
- Must implement image augmentation.
- Using an image data generator.
- The model must use a sequential model.
- The training model does not exceed 30 minutes.
- The program was carried out at Google Colaboratory.
- The accuracy of the model is at least 85%.
- Can predict images uploaded to Colab
